The LargeSurfaceVisualizer is a software module to visualize arbitrary large raster or image data in 2D and 3D. 
Using an iipimage server and javascript, the LargeSurfaceVisualizer can render very high-resolution images such as scanned surfaces, Terrains/DEMs, or other 2.5D datasets in your browser.
